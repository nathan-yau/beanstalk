# Beanstalk
Beanstalk is a financial app for stock watchers and investors built using React.js and Node.js. It provides near real-time stock market data, allowing users to monitor their favorite stocks and track their portfolios. The mobile app offers a sleek and intuitive user interface with personalized dashboards and comprehensive portfolio management tools.
